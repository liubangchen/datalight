#+startup: showall
regenerated data for ICU library.

You can regenerate this data in the following way:

1. Download ICU source code: https://github.com/unicode-org/icu
2. In icu4c/source directory run ./configure and make.
3. The resulting file will be located at ./data/out/tmp/icudt70l_dat.S

Motivation: ICU is using complicated two-stage build process that is hard to integrate to the build system of another project.
